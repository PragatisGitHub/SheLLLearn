# SheLLLearn
SheLLLearn is an interactive learning tool designed to evaluate writing skills using a trained computer model.
Our model has many applications including the teaching of young children and those who are new to English as well as those using physical therapy to regain mobility and hone their writing skills after injury or stroke for example.  Additionally future builds will be able to evaluate lower case numbers, beginning letter sounds and more!
